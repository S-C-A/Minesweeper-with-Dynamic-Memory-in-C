 Classic Minesweeper written with dynamic memory allocation.

  Upon opening the game you choose how many bombs you wish to place on a 10x10 grid. Afterwards the real game starts and your goal is successfully putting flags on all the bombs. If you manage to put flags on 
 bombs and no other tile you will win but if you reveal a bomb then you instantly lose!

  To make a move first choose whether you want to place a flag or reveal a spot then select the location by first putting the row then the column.(Exmple: 4 6). You need to put a space inbetween the row and column.

   Have fun!
